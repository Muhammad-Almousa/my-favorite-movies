## How it works?
If you want to run this program you need to do the folling:

### Step 1:
You need to clone my Github repository or download it as zip file from the and unyip the files.

### Step 2:
Download Python from  [HERE](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).

### Step 3:
Open Pythen Shell. then go to the menu and choose from `File` the option  'open' or use the shortcut `ctrl + O`.

### Step 4:
Go to the files that you had already downloaded from Github. Open the file `entertenment_center.py`. Here you will find the instances of the class variables. you can run the code from the `menu` simply by pressing on `Run`. Then choose `Run Module`. You can create your own list of movies by replacing the informatin and the links.

### Step 5:
To see how the class is built, open another file which is `media.py`. The first thing you will see is 'import webbrowser' which is a class from python standard library you can read about it more [HERE](https://docs.python.org/2/library/webbrowser.html).
Then `class Movie():`; it contains two functions: The first one is `def __init__():`



When you open it you'll see the poster's images of my favorite movies. You can also whatch the trailer of the movie by clicking on the poster image.
Use Python IDLE to run the code.
To get the documentation of the instances use the comand `__doc__` in Python shell.
