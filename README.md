## My favorite movies:
It is a website which contains my favorite movies.
## which languages?
It is made using python as server a language,HTML and CSS.
## How it works?
If you want to run this program you need to do the folling:

### Step 1:
You need to clone my Github repository or download it as zip file from the and unyip the files.

### Step 2:
Download Python from  [HERE](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).

### Step 3:
Open Pythen Shell. then go to the menu and choose from `File` the option  'open' or use the shortcut `ctrl + O`.

### Step 4:
Go to the files that you had already downloaded from Github. Open the file `entertenment_center.py`. Here you will find the instances of the class variables. you can run the code from the `menu` simply by pressing on `Run`. Then choose `Run Module`. After that your browser will open a window with the poster's images of my favorite movies. You can also whatch the trailer of the movie by clicking on the poster image.  You can create your own list of movies by replacing the informatin and the links. The word `import` helps to connect other files and classes with each other when they are needed.

### Step 5:
To see how the class is built, open another file which is `media.py`. The first thing you will see is `import webbrowser` which is a class from python standard library you can read about it more [HERE](https://docs.python.org/2/library/webbrowser.html).
Then `class Movie():`; it contains two functions: The first one is `def __init__():`the `__init__` method is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object. The other one is `def show_trailer():` to show the trailer of the movie.
